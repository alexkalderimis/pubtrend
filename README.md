## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

## Usage

The web-app loads initally showing the publication trend for
pubmed entries that match "asthma" since 2000. The window of time
can be changed by entering a start and end year in the control
form, pressing the `earlier` and `later` buttons or pressing the
`left` and `right` arrows on your keyboard.

One or more search terms can be entered, and the data for each
trend will be overlaid in the chart area.
